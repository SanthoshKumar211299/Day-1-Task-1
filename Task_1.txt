 Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2:
 HTTP1:
 -------
 Development: It was developed in the year 1997
 Compression: It compresses data by itself.
 Binary Protocol: A text-based protocol uses plain text to encode and transmit data.
 Security: The client sends a request to a server, and the server sends a response back to the client
 Multiplexing:A separate connection is established for each request and response, which can add overhead and latency to the communication process.
 Buffer Overflow:HTTP 1.1 cannot handle buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to the lack of sufficient measures
 Performance:HTTP 1.1 does not include any in-built features, so the performance it delivers is less efficient.

 HTTP1:
 -------
 Development:It was developed in the year 2015.
 Compression:It uses HPACK for data compression.
 Binary Protocol:It works on the binary protocol as a series of binary codes encode and transmit data rather than plain text.
 Security:A different underlying protocol called Secure Remote Protocol 2 (SRP2) establishes a secure connection between a client and a server.
 Multiplexing:It allows multiplexing so multiple requests and responses can be sent over a single connection.
 Buffer Overflow:HTTP 2 includes measures to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
 Performance:HTTP 2 is designed to be more efficient and performant than HTTP 1.1. This is because HTTP 2 includes several features like multiplexing, binary protocol and header compression.
